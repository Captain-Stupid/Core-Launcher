# CoreLauncher
This is a custom game launcher made for the game Core Keeper. It uses the Mod IO API so you will need a Mod IO account. If you have any questions please contact me at `Core Keeper Discord Server > Modding > Available Mods > Core Launcher` or dm me at `super_miner_1`.

# Why Godot?
### Godot is a game engine, so why am I using it for this project?
Godot provides lots of useful features -- especially for ui. Godot is also very lightweight for a game engine which makes it a good choice for this project.

# Roadmap/TODO
## v1.1.0
- Create system for mods to provide extra data in their descriptions
- Allow use with the Core Keeper Dedicated Server
- Add option to view mods in a grid instead of a list
- Add a button to toggle the options screen
## Beyond
- Menu for creating backups of the game / your world, character, etc. files
- More customizability
  - Custom background image
  - Custom themes
- More settings
  - Edit game and mod configs from the launcher
  - Rename characters and worlds from the launcher
- Faster installations (these things need testing, I'm not sure if they'll work)
  - Faster client mod installations by changing state.json
  - Faster dedicated server installations by only installing/uninstalling the modmanifest.json file
- Cache mod logos
